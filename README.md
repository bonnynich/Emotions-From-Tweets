# Emotions From Tweets

Text classification is important in professions like marketing because consumers are sharing their opinions through text more now than they ever have before. As a result, there is a lot of unstructured data that can be tapped into to learn more about the concerns and needs of consumers. The goal of this project is to build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content. The dataset used for this project was a scrape of tweets corresponding to the sxsw festival and the technology used at the festival.
