Welcome!
This project is the Module 4 Project as part of the Flatiron School self-paced data science program. Text classification is important in professions like marketing because consumers are sharing their opinions through text more now than they ever have before. As a result, there is a lot of unstructured data that can be tapped into to learn more about the concerns and needs of consumers. The goal of this project is to build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content.
